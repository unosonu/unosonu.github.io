Hello, my name is Atul Anand. I am a self proclaimed data scientist who likes anything and everthing related to machine learning and computer science among many things. My study background is in computer science. I like to think about big problems. At the time of writing I am motivated by a problem whose solution may have impact for good for many people. In my self constructional period I read, paint or learn a musical instrument.

If you want to consult, teach or work with me, feel free to contact me. I will be glad to respond.
