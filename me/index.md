Hello, my name is Atul Anand. I am a working as a data science professional who likes anything and everthing related to machine learning and computer science among many things. My study background is in computer science.

I have rendered interesting solutions to the leading companies in their domains. I get enticed by a problem which is said to be unfeasible. I like to compete in kaggle. I am an avid coursera learner and in the past completed numerous coursera courses such as jeoffery hinton, andrew ng, machine learning by university of washington and data science specialization course offered by John Hopkins University by Professor Roger D. Peng, Professor Brian Caffo and Professor Jeff Leek. 

I like to think about big problems. In my self constructional period I read, paint or build telescope and microscopes.
