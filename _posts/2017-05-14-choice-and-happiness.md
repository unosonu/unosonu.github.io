title: Choice and happiness
---
I see TED talks and wonder how they affect my life. For example, when I saw the TED talk about the puzzle of motivation, I kind of understood what kind of job I will be interested in and what and what not motivates me for my day job. It may not affect or tell a secret sauce to change you life in one day but does shows a lot of subtle things that we can do to change in our daily lives which may have a big impact eventually.

Today's post is about choices and how they are vastly important to govern our happiness in the modern world. I take responsibility of the thoughts which come largerly from the few ted talks which I will mention later in the post. The content below is a mix of my ideas and my understanding of the content in these talks. The interesting part happens when ideas in the two talks contradict when it comes to the happiness of consumers and in personal aspect as well. I will try to clarify the conflict. I would also try to arrive at a conclusion about where your marketing study efforts should go in order to please your customers. 

If you haven't seen the talks yet you may want to see it beforehand. I am going to put some points to focus on here for each of the ted talks and then we will arrive at the conflict.

The first video is that of __Malcolm gladwell__ ([here](https://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce)) where he talks about the food industry (we want to see the obsevations beyond this domain as well) and it's earlier assumptions. He tells a story of how Howard markowitz changed the food industry in three important ways:

1. People don't know what they want. They come to know of it when given with choices. It may be that if you ask the consumers directly how do you want your coffee. There can be numerous reason for this like they may not be honest or creative or something like that. We can't always explain what we want deep down. We seem to be sometimes(or all the time) manipulated by our own opinions about ourselves and feel confident about it. Malcolm gives multiple examples to validate this point. 

2. Universal to variability is incorrect. That there is no one kind of tomato sauce to satify the tastes of a billion people. There is no single perfect way to make a dish. There has to be a different perfect recepies for different people. 

3. Horizontal segmentation. Conventional way to market the products was that people want something higher, more expensive, something to make people aspire to, even if it was only for mustard sauce. Howard's idea and he proves that idea is that "The way to make more people more happy, is by making different types of mustard for different types of people". 

In the end Malcolm Gladwell says and I quote __In embracing diversity of human beings we will find a surer way to true happiness__. By this he means more varied products for such diversified population in so many aspect human beings.

Let's move on to the second talk. This is by __Barry swartz__ on __paradox of choice__ ([here](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice)). Barry tries to relate freedom with choice. The freedom he talks about is general. He says it's conventional practise if you maximize choice you maximize freedom. I don't agree(for me freedom has a larger sense not only in consumerism. It means you maximize freedom of choice. You will say that he might mean that, I say no, he does understand that but he didn't convey the same specially in the beginning of the talk. This can be ignored as a trivial but 'to be aware of' bug. 

He presents lots of stats to state that having more choices make you take no choice at all. Or if you happen to choose one you will feel miserable. The reason is that you actually care what choice you make(it's much more elaborated in Dan Aierly's talk and I will also write more on this when I write about his talk). You don't want to make a wrong choice if it's for eternity or close (like choosing a life partner) or even if it's as trivial as choosing you salad dressing.

His valid point is if you choose from more choices be it anything you will be less satisfied; Less satisfied compared to the choice you have had to make when there were less items to choose from, because then you will not be whining about that you could have had better results with a choice that you left out. He state 3 resons for the unhappiness caused by choosing:

1. Imagination of alternative choices that one could have had made causes regret. He also states that in earlier times when people had less choices people happened to be more happy in the given choice. Because they couldn't have made another choice.

2. Opportunity costs - We value things which we compare them to. Attractive features of alternatives that we reject. Missing the opportunity costs of parking space when you are in vacation. 

3. Escalation of expectations - Barry gives example of buying jeans from slim fit, easy fit, and exact fit. This makes a person choose better but makes him feel worse. "good results but less satisfaction".

4. Guilt - If the pair of jeans you bought turns out to be a bad fit, who's responsible for it. You! Since you chose it.Just the thought that you could have had made a better choice makes you feel bad. You blame yourself, even if you chose good.

Now here's the conflict of happiness from the two talks. One talk tells that secret to consumer happiness is more choices, where as another talk says it's less choices. Both of them show this statistically. Barry says that there is a 2% decrease for every 10 new choices for mutual funds. It's true because it puts more hard work to choose from more choices. For the same reason we don't pay attention to 1% or 1.5% brokerage charges on our mutual fund instments but negotiate for few dollars in the daily market because the calculation of it makes more difficult. Some may say that more choices lead to more happiness is in the case of food industry only. But I would argue that's not the case, it is more like both the results are specificaition of the same general thing. But before arriving there and to make matter more complex let us move in to the final ted talk which is by  __Dan Ariely__ on __are we in control of making our own decisions__ ([here](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions)).

Dan talks about __decision making illusions__. He starts off by stating that if our minds can be tricked by visual illusions how can we confidently say that we are not making bad decisions unknowingly everyday especially when most of our life is based on choosing. He gives and example of filling a form and how users get tricked into selecting default option. Because it can be that not selecting anything or avoiding yourself from making a choice will lead to another choice which you may not want either. 
As Dan puts it we have an illusion of making a decision rather than making a decision. And this happens because we care, it's difficult and it's complex to make even small decisions. In order to not to make a mistake or if it becomes too much work, in the moment we don't know what to do. We just pick what was chosen for us. You may ask "does this happen with the subject experts as well ?". Dan provides an example. Physicians decision about surgery of a patient changes when two new medicines were suggested rather than suggesting only one medicine. Most likely it becomes too much work. 

Now we have _two types of irrational decision making_. First as I explained, we just pick what was chosen for us. The second type can be explained from dating example. Out of two people on a dating site (both of them comparably look good) the one becomes more popular whose similar uglier version is introduced. This is constantly used by marketers when providing offers, in malls, in mutual funds by providing an extra option to compare with. This tells we are not so much in control of making our decisions(it's person who creates choices for us). Dan ariely says our mental world has limitations just like our physical world. Understanding our congnitive limitations will help us design better stock market, healthcare, retirement plans and other important stuff.

But how do we solve the conflict. Dan Ariely says introduction of an inferior option (useless option which no body wants) helps people figure out what they wanted. This is good and bad because it can used to make you like an option which has been made to look more attractive by introducing a inferior choice at the same cost. According to Malcolm more choices, diversification of products lead to more happiness. According to Barry choosing from surplus choices make us feel miserable.

Here is my opnion:
Barry's concluding remarks are 'some choice are better than none but more choice is not better than some choice'. Here 'some choice' has to be defined by our welfare, past our welfare is more choice.

It's not proper quantization, see that welfare is not limited. We always want more, things can always be improved. Now the sense I believe that he talks about is the same, whatever fills the needs, the present and near future requirement but it doesn't adress the aesthetic part of the products or products which have more of aesthetic part.

Give people when they know what they want. Things with specific functionality - this has to do with requirements, with capability of devices, with needs, but when it comes to fashion, taste, food, perfection; I feel perfection is a personal taste. There people may not know completely well what they want, they may need choices, clothes to try on how they look, which looks better, same goes with food many a time. But when it comes to a car, a bike, a cell phone, people want better in lesser prices, it's about more features. 

We can say there are two types of properties in a product, it's functional value - based on the present/future need. The other one is the creative value which is brand(this may be a need for some people but I will still qualify it as a taste), looks, appearance, garnish, ambience, art. One may find drastic differences in the price value of the two properties. 
What and why the value of a $20,000 art hanging on a wall has much less use than a much cheaper window in it's place for an example or a simple laptop or tablet, ofcourse if you have that painting, you must be having a good laptop already or another window in it's place. Which means you have ample money. Is it that people who have more money become inclined to taste side of the product and willing to compromise in functionality. You know higher functionality and asthetics is a higher risk of robbery, why risk you happiness(one example). I feel it has to do with taste and taste affordability and buying wisdom.

Some will argue about the _design_ of the product. I would say doesn't it merge the two of it, the aesthetics and the functionality. Some will say this painting is of historical value. I understand and for this reason it needs to be saved and preserved not owned for show off. Some will say it's about the feelings it generates in a person when you look at the art. I am not talking about art. But if it's such an art that can move a million people away to do from what they do in daily life then I would say that should be included in education and it simply doesn't qualify for a mere money value. And think of the feeling of a single person costing 20k dollars.

Governments and corporates build things that we like, pay attention to, your one cent is their one billion. This accumulation of attention is so powerful and few govern it because they seem to have cracked crowd mindset. Apple for example has design and fucntionality but in countries like India(I cannot comment on country outside) what decides it's value - 'Staus symbol'. As a result many people don't invest into houses but buy a 70k rupee phone. In their mind it gives them immediate status. That amount could be a saving in the form of gold. I have observed this with regural income people. And they have a hard time explaining why they bought it and why it was needed for them. But this is beyond our point and our conflict. I just stepped over the boundry and now I pull back.

More choices give us more freedom to choose for our welfare. We choose from better options, better is defined by more quality/features in lesser price. Quality can be anything, a time saving option can also be a quality. According to Barry we don't want too many choices, that makes us miserable after buying. According to him __the key to happiness is less expectations__. The user can implement it on their side, it's like a personal tap. But how to know, how many choices are too many choices? We just saw Dan says introduction of one useless choice help people to know what they want. I think of following things.

a. Decide on the number of choices based on market study. Do a market segmentation properly, so as to know how much diversification is required. United Colors of Benetton doesn't produce too many shoes or designs. Their showrooms keep some of it and make it easy to choose from a selected few.

b. Now all these choices will be available to user at the same time. How will he get to know what was manufactured for him. So Market the right thing to the right person is the key(key to happiness). The user won't get blinded by so many options resulting in not buying anything. Levis skinny fit was something all skinny people were looking for. And making proper segmented sizes in the showrooms easier to find helps people to go to the proper size in mind. 

c. In cell phones or bikes people don't seem so confused as buying apparels. It's easier to reject based on the features. Such products suit the types of needs of people. Here too much number of the same kind is not ok. incremental models are what to be found, more price based on more number of the features. Mutual funds need to be designed better.

d. If there are too much asethic part of a product it can be mind boggling. Inform the user by telling how the design is suited for the specific user rather than come and try all our products and choose the best one from it.

e. For the user don't be guided by guilt but by need. Use the tap.

f. Give people what they want when they know about it. Choice are reqired to clear this when they don't have an idea.

This is it. Did I answer all I promised?
